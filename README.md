# Highlight Dictionary
(working on a better name)
A way for me to stop making new tabs just to look up what a word or phrase means. I can just highlight it and a pop up shows me a definition

## Current Features
- Highlight a word/ any piece of text and a popup gets show with the text you highlighted

## Planned features
- Implementing it with an AI api that takes in that text and brings back a definition


# How to use
- fork and clone repo
- Nothing to download, just go to chrome extensions -> manage extension -> Load unpacked -> choose file where this project lives --- et voila

## Blockers
- Getting an AI API
