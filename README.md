# Context Buddy
A way for me to stop making new tabs just to look up what a word or phrase means. I can just highlight it and a pop up shows me a definition

## Current Features
- Highlight a word/ any piece of text and a popup gets show with the text you highlighted along with a definition related to the context of the page

## Planned features
- Making it usable for others who clone the repo
- Creating functionality on any page that can be toggled on or off

# How to use
 - Coming soon

## Blockers
- Figuring out how to hide API key
