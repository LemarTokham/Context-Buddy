# Highlight Dictionary
(working on a better name)
A way for me to stop making new tabs just to look up what a word or phrase means. I can just highlight it and a pop up shows me a definition

## Current Features
- Highlight a word/ any piece of text and it gets outputted to the console

## Planned features
- A pop up showing what you highlighted
- Implementing it with an AI api that takes in that text and brings back a definition

## Blockers
- Remembering how to use vanilla JS
